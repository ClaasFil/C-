Programming 2 Coursework Repository

This repository contains my coursework from the "Programming 2" class, part of the Computer Science Bachelor's program at the University of Vienna. It includes:

    C++ Vector Class: A custom implementation showcasing dynamic memory management, operator overloading, and exception handling.
    Smart Pointers in C++: Demonstrates the use of smart pointers (std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr, and std::weak_ptr) for robust and efficient memory management, highlighting modern C++ memory management practices and preventing memory leaks.
    Java OOP Examples: A collection of Java files demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming principles through a magical world simulation, focusing on inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

For more detailed information on each implementation, please refer to the respective folders within this repository.
